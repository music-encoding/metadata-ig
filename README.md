# metadata-ig
The repository of the Metadata Interest Group

## What is it for?
This is a workspace where the metadata-ig store code snippets, examples and text blocs for further development. It is also a place for managing discussions, issues and so on.

## The structure
At the moment there is a big task to make a proposal for missing documentation of the guidelines Chapter 3(.7). All code that belongs to this task is stored in the [guidelines_chapter_3](https://github.com/music-encoding/metadata-ig/tree/main/guidelines_chapter_3) directory.
- Inside you can find a file (copy of the music-encoding odd) where the drafts of the ig are implemented. When the draft is ready it will be pushed to a draft:pullRequest for further discussion with the whole MEI community.
- The directory [website-compiled-dev](https://github.com/music-encoding/metadata-ig/tree/main/guidelines_chapter_3/website-compiled-dev) contains a static dev version of the MEI Guidelines including the very first drafts of the ig's proposals, for testing purpose. Please note that this directory is not updated in regular periods!
